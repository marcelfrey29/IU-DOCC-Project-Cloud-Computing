# Plan Cloud Migration

Migrate the local version of the application to the AWS Cloud.

## Criteria

- Sclalability and Fit-to-Workload
- Availability
- Security
    - In Transit
    - At Rest
- Cost (Infrastructure)
- Operational Model
    - Capacity Planning
    - Maintenance / Patching
- Risk of Lock-In

> [!WARNING] 
> For Scalability and Fit-to-Workload we have to assume a usage scenario. 
>
> We assume that our application is heaviliy used before and after the vacation-season. 
> This means we expect four spikes over the year (Before Summer, After Summer, Before Winter, After Winter).
>
> Before users go to vaction, they get inspiration on what to do at their location. 
> While the load is higher in general, we will have many read-operations.
>
> Once people come back, they might create their own travel guide to inspire other travelers. 
> While the load is higher in general, we will have more write-operations. 

>[!WARNING]
> To make a fair price comparison, we must compare the solutions with the same level of availability and scalability.
> 
> For example, AWS Lambda is hightly available by default because it uses all Availability Zones (Re-architecture). 
> While a single server would be enough for the Rehost and Replatform solution, we will calculate the price with 3 instances and a load balancer to have the same level of availability.

>[!NOTE]
> Some general criteria apply to all migration strategies
> - Deployment Model (Public Cloud)
> - Utility Pricing / No upfront costs
> - Internet Connectivity / Outages
> - Data Deletion

    - **Rehosting**: Lift-and-shift
        - Move existing workloads as they are
        - No cloud optimization
    - **Replatforming**: Lift-thinker-and-shift
        - Core Architecture stays unchanged
        - A few cloud optimizations are performed
    - **Refactoring/Re-architecting**
        - Use cloud-native features
