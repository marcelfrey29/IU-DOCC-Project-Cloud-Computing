# Requirements

**GitHub Issues** is used to document requirements, tasks and bugs. 
Different Labels have been defined to categorize the issues.

Issues are assigned to **Milestones**. Two Milestones have been identified:

- Local Implementation: Initial Development of the Application
- Cloud Migration: Migration to the Cloud 

Requirements for the Application are defined as **User Stories**.
The title of each issues is the User Story.
The ticket description contains additional details and constraints about the user story.
User Stories receive the label `category: feature request`.

Technical tasks that are not directly related to application functionality are labeled as `category: task`.

Issues are further labeled with information about the _area_ they affect (from a technical perspective).
For example, issues related to the frontend are labeled with `area: web app` while issues related to the backend are labeled with `area: backend`.
